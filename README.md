# COE328
Collection of assignments completed by me in the course COE328 - Digital Systems

Description of COE328 as per the Toronto Metropolitan University: 

This course covers the basics digital logic circuits and emphasizes on good understanding of basic concepts in modern digital system design. The course introduces computer aided design (CAD) tools including the use of hardware description language (HDL) for design entry. It also discusses the use of the latest available implementation technologies including CPLDs and FPGAs for mapping the design to modern technology. This course covers basic logic circuits, Boolean algebra, and implementation technology (from transistor to CPLDs and FPGAs). It also introduces logic functions optimization and implementation, number representation and arithmetic circuits, combinational circuits, synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits as well as introduction to control unit data path and CPU operations. The Laboratory work requires the uses of CAD tools to design and simulate basic digital circuits. Implementation and testing of simple digital systems in LSI and CPLD will also be considered.
