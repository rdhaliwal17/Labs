Hello!

This repository documents the practical laboratory work and technical projects completed during my undergraduate Computer Engineering studies. It spans the full spectrum of my coursework, ranging from hardware design in VHDL to object-oriented programming. This portfolio serves as a centralized record of my technical growth across both hardware and software disciplines.
